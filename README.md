# DDoS Attack Simulator (Educational)

## Overview
This project simulates DDoS attacks in a safe, controlled environment for educational purposes. It helps students and security enthusiasts understand:
- Traffic spikes
- Resource consumption
- Mitigation techniques

**Important:** Only run on your own machines or isolated virtual environments.

## Features
- Multiple attack types: HTTP, TCP SYN, UDP
- Configurable attacker nodes
- Real-time traffic and resource visualization
- Logging and analysis
- Mitigation demonstration (rate-limiting)

## Setup
1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
